However, I didn't get a good look at it, and I recall that it was the dull White-throated sparrow (certainly not a bright one). Looking back over the species habits, though, I think that this was actually a Swamp Sparrow, as both birds were flitting in the cattails in the marsh area, and not comfortable outside on the berm of the road. I don't think a White-throated Sparrow would have hopped into a clearly marshy area of cattails - over standing water, even - and I recall that this bird lacked streaking which might make it one of the other sparrows (Song, Vesper, etc). Changed this to Swamp Sparrow a few days later, on all of this reflection. Looking forward to the next time I see one to confirm habits.","Checklist Comments":"Walking around close to the car, within 100m of it.

They had very thin necks, which was different than the Common Merganser females I would otherwise call these. They also seemed smaller. After around two minutes, they all flew off to the northwest, and they had white underwings.    I had called these Horned Grebes. However, after a long discussion with Ian Worley and others through him, I'm changing these to Red-breasted Mergansers.  Here's some justification from Ian's emails for this change:     \"The first thing that rules out Horned Grebe is the complete dark head, with the border of the dark area slanting down from the chin and then extending around the neck including the upper part of the neck.  A Horned Grebe would have the bottom edge of the black extending from the base of the upper bill, through the eye and then to the peak of the crown.    \"Secondly, the light area of the neck is not just at the throat, but extend completely around the neck.  A Horned Grebe would show the back of the neck, and a bit of the side of the neck as being darker than the throat (or encircle the whole neck).    \"Third, the body length is similar to that of the Lesser Scaup.  The body length of a Horned Grebe would be noticeably shorter.    \"Fourth, you say they all flew away together.  That is definitely not a Horned Grebe Trait. Over years of observing them, I can't actually remember ever seeing one fly but once or twice.   On the other hand, Red-breasted Mergansers are quite apt to fly from local place to local place in small groups of four to six or so.  Also you did not mention that any sunk and swam, as would be the habit for the grebes.    \"So the photos do not add up to Horned Grebes.  And the behavior didn't lean that direction.    \"I'm reasonably well convinced that they most likely were Red-breasted Mergansers.    \"Red-breasted Mergansers have been reported from that part of the Colchester Causeway this year from March 4th to March 9th.  A group of four was photographed on the 7th.   One Horned Grebe was reported from there on March 13th.","Checklist Comments":"Walked down the track from Martin Road.","ML Catalog Numbers":"143780401 143780451 143781161","State":"Vermont","Town":"South Hero"},{"Submission ID":"S53378648","Common Name":"Mourning Dove","Scientific Name":"Zenaida macroura","Taxonomic Order":"2339","Count":"2","State/Province":"US-VT","County":"Grand Isle","Location ID":"L293922","Location":"South Hero Causeway","Latitude":"44.5934815","Longitude":"-73.3117418","Date":"2019-03-04","Time":"06:26 AM","Protocol":"eBird - Traveling Count","Duration (Min)":"116","All Obs Reported":"1","Distance Traveled (km)":"3.559","Area Covered (ha)":"","Number of Observers":"2","Breeding Code":"","Observation Details":"","Checklist Comments":"Walked down the track from Martin Road.","State":"Vermont","Town":"South Hero"},{"Submission ID":"S53379255","Common Name":"Herring Gull (American)","Scientific Name":"Larus argentatus","Taxonomic Order":"6276","Count":"1","State/Province":"US-VT","County":"Grand Isle","Location ID":"L8756485","Location":"47–51 US Route 2, South Hero US-VT (44.6319,-73.2573)","Latitude":"44.63192","Longitude":"-73.257333","Date":"2019-03-04","Time":"08:42 AM","Protocol":"eBird - Stationary Count","Duration (Min)":"7","All Obs Reported":"1","Distance Traveled (km)":"","Area Covered (ha)":"","Number of Observers":"2","Breeding Code":"","Observation Details":"","Checklist Comments":"Saw birds while driving.

The bird was tan all over, without large white sections, and it lacked black tips on its primaries. It was sitting on the long mounds perpendicular to the main mound where most of the gulls normally sit.    Any other comments would be biased by the photographs above, and based on the time elapsed - 1.5 months - since submitted this post and updating this comment, probably wouldn't be helpful. I spoke to Bryan Pfeiffer soon after seeing this gull - within a day or two - and confirmed the lack of black tips with him.","State":"Vermont","Town":"Moretown"}],"2019-01-12":[{"Submission ID":"S51581616","Common Name":"Red-tailed Hawk (borealis)","Scientific Name":"Buteo jamaicensis","Taxonomic Order":"8015","Count":"1","State/Province":"US-VT","County":"Washington","Location ID":"L5132708","Location":"Grow Compost","Latitude":"44.3111362","Longitude":"-72.7148581","Date":"2019-01-12","Time":"08:52 AM","Protocol":"eBird - Traveling Count","Duration (Min)":"12","All Obs Reported":"1","Distance Traveled (km)":".697","Area Covered (ha)":"","Number of Observers":"2","Breeding Code":"","Observation Details":"Probably immature.

but seemed smaller and more nasal. No other crows around like this one.    Update: I'm not entirely sure that this is, indeed, a Fish Crow. I think it is the same individual that has been seen near the compost for the past month. The audio files updated by Graham Rice and Jim Mead sound identical, so I think that this may be the same crow.     However, there are a few salient features which may mean it is an American Crow. For one, primaries 7, 8, and 9 seem to be almost equidistant. They could be of differentiable length - the bird is not in my hand - but from the photos, they don't look as pointed as I would expect. The back feathers also show some scaling, in one sun-dappled photo, but these are beneath the mantle and might be larger, anyway, so I don't trust this feature for differentiation. Unfortunately, the fifth primary on the right side appears to be growing in. This can't be molt (wrong season), but because of this I can't judge the size difference between it and p9.     In its favor, I have multiple shots of the bird calling, and it appears to be extending its throat without hunching down like a normal crow. However, in a video, I have one segment where it fluffs its feathers before cawing, and then its throat feathers were still distended. This makes me not trust this feature at all.     The bird does seem more of a glossy purple than normal, and it had fast wingbeats. It also appeared smaller to me, but it was not directly near other crows for this assessment.     It doesn't appear to have a hook on its beak, but my photos are not high-resolution enough.    The caw itself still seems more nasal to me than a begging female American Crow. So, given that an individual is known to live here, and that none of the features above seem to permanently disqualify it, I am going to keep this as a Fish Crow, and agree that IDing is very hard.","Checklist Comments":"","ML Catalog Numbers":"153947231 153947601 153964841 153964851 153964861 153964871 153964881 153964891","State":"Vermont","Town":"Essex"},{"Submission ID":"S55404141","Common Name":"Common Raven","Scientific Name":"Corvus corax","Taxonomic Order":"20703","Count":"2","State/Province":"US-VT","County":"Chittenden","Location ID":"L8032680","Location":"Saint Michael's College Natural Area","Latitude":"44.4966632","Longitude":"-73.1523212","Date":"2019-04-25","Time":"04:02 PM","Protocol":"eBird -
