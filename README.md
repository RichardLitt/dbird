> Putting [eBird](https://ebird.org) on the decentralized web

## Background

This is an attempt for me to start building small databases of my own personal eBird data and putting it on the decentralized web. Rather than build a monumental thing, I am trying to build a bit at a time.

## Install

Clone this repo. This is not on npm at the moment.

## Usage

For now, this is only usable through the CLI.

Running `node cli.js` will provide a list of targets of all kinds, assuming you have downloaded your [Target Species](https://ebird.org/targets) lists for the same location and date range and put them into `html_files`, with the names `audio.html`, `photos.html`, and `species.html`. Use the gear icon to change between audio and photo targets.

Example files have been uploaded from my account for Vermont in September 2019 (as of this date).

## Contribute

Please feel free. This is a pretty low-key project. Suggestions always welcome, of course, and possible features too.

I'll try to track my goals using the GitHub issue tracker.
