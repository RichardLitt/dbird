However, I didn't get a good look at it, and I recall that it was the dull White-throated sparrow (certainly not a bright one). Looking back over the species habits, though, I think that this was actually a Swamp Sparrow, as both birds were flitting in the cattails in the marsh area, and not comfortable outside on the berm of the road. I don't think a White-throated Sparrow would have hopped into a clearly marshy area of cattails - over standing water, even - and I recall that this bird lacked streaking which might make it one of the other sparrows (Song, Vesper, etc). Changed this to Swamp Sparrow a few days later, on all of this reflection. Looking forward to the next time I see one to confirm habits.","Checklist Comments":"Walking around close to the car, within 100m of it.

but seemed smaller and more nasal. No other crows around like this one.    Update: I'm not entirely sure that this is, indeed, a Fish Crow. I think it is the same individual that has been seen near the compost for the past month. The audio files updated by Graham Rice and Jim Mead sound identical, so I think that this may be the same crow.     However, there are a few salient features which may mean it is an American Crow. For one, primaries 7, 8, and 9 seem to be almost equidistant. They could be of differentiable length - the bird is not in my hand - but from the photos, they don't look as pointed as I would expect. The back feathers also show some scaling, in one sun-dappled photo, but these are beneath the mantle and might be larger, anyway, so I don't trust this feature for differentiation. Unfortunately, the fifth primary on the right side appears to be growing in. This can't be molt (wrong season), but because of this I can't judge the size difference between it and p9.     In its favor, I have multiple shots of the bird calling, and it appears to be extending its throat without hunching down like a normal crow. However, in a video, I have one segment where it fluffs its feathers before cawing, and then its throat feathers were still distended. This makes me not trust this feature at all.     The bird does seem more of a glossy purple than normal, and it had fast wingbeats. It also appeared smaller to me, but it was not directly near other crows for this assessment.     It doesn't appear to have a hook on its beak, but my photos are not high-resolution enough.    The caw itself still seems more nasal to me than a begging female American Crow. So, given that an individual is known to live here, and that none of the features above seem to permanently disqualify it, I am going to keep this as a Fish Crow, and agree that IDing is very hard.","Checklist Comments":"","ML Catalog Numbers":"153947231 153947601 153964841 153964851 153964861 153964871 153964881 153964891","State":"Vermont","Region":"Champlain Valley"},{"Submission ID":"S55404141","Common Name":"Ruby-crowned Kinglet","Scientific Name":"Regulus calendula","Taxonomic Order":"25797","Count":"2","State/Province":"US-VT","County":"Chittenden","Location ID":"L8032680","Location":"Saint Michael's College Natural Area","Latitude":"44.4966632","Longitude":"-73.1523212","Date":"2019-04-25","Time":"04:02 PM","Protocol":"eBird - Traveling Count","Duration (Min)":"90","All Obs Reported":"1","Distance Traveled (km)":"4.091","Area Covered (ha)":"","Number of Observers":"1","Breeding Code":"","Observation Details":"","Checklist Comments":"","ML Catalog Numbers":"153965151","State":"Vermont","Region":"Champlain Valley"},{"Submission ID":"S55404141","Common Name":"House Finch","Scientific Name":"Haemorhous mexicanus","Taxonomic Order":"31084","Count":"2","State/Province":"US-VT","County":"Chittenden","Location ID":"L8032680","Location":"Saint Michael's College Natural Area","Latitude":"44.4966632","Longitude":"-73.1523212","Date":"2019-04-25","Time":"04:02 PM","Protocol":"eBird - Traveling Count","Duration (Min)":"90","All Obs Reported":"1","Distance Traveled (km)":"4.091","Area Covered (ha)":"","Number of Observers":"1","Breeding Code":"","Observation Details":"","Checklist Comments":"","ML Catalog Numbers":"153962431","State":"Vermont","Region":"Champlain Valley"},{"Submission ID":"S55404141","Common Name":"American Goldfinch","Scientific Name":"Spinus tristis","Taxonomic Order":"31382","Count":"1","State/Province":"US-VT","County":"Chittenden","Location ID":"L8032680","Location":"Saint Michael's College Natural Area","Latitude":"44.4966632","Longitude":"-73.1523212","Date":"2019-04-25","Time":"04:02 PM","Protocol":"eBird - Traveling Count","Duration (Min)":"90","All Obs Reported":"1","Distance Traveled (km)":"4.091","Area Covered (ha)":"","Number of Observers":"1","Breeding Code":"","Observation Details":"","Checklist Comments":"","ML Catalog Numbers":"153962361","State":"Vermont","Region":"Champlain Valley"},{"Submission ID":"S55404141","Common Name":"Pine Warbler","Scientific Name":"Setophaga pinus","Taxonomic Order":"32853","Count":"1","State/Province":"US-VT","County":"Chittenden","Location ID":"L8032680","Location":"Saint Michael's College Natural Area","Latitude":"44.4966632","Longitude":"-73.1523212","Date":"2019-04-25","Time":"04:02 PM","Protocol":"eBird - Traveling Count","Duration (Min)":"90","All Obs Reported":"1","Distance Traveled (km)":"4.091","Area Covered (ha)":"","Number of Observers":"1","State":"Vermont","Region":"Champlain Valley"},{"Submission ID":"S55404141","Common Name":"Yellow-rumped Warbler","Scientific Name":"Setophaga coronata","Taxonomic Order":"32858","Count":"2","State/Province":"US-VT","County":"Chittenden","Location ID":"L8032680","Location":"Saint Michael's College Natural Area","Latitude":"44.4966632","Longitude":"-73.1523212","Date":"2019-04-25","Time":"04:02 PM","Protocol":"eBird - Traveling Count","Duration (Min)":"90","All Obs Reported":"1","Distance Traveled (km)":"4.091","Area Covered (ha)":"","Number of Observers":"1","Breeding Code":"","Observation Details":"","Checklist Comments":"","ML Catalog Numbers":"153965201 153965211 153965221 153965231 153965241","State":"Vermont","Region":"Champlain Valley"}],"2019-04-27":[{"Submission ID":"S55528364","Common Name":"Chimney Swift","Scientific Name":"Chaetura pelagica","Taxonomic Order":"3755","Count":"4","State/Province":"US-VT","County":"Franklin","Location ID":"L9140078","Location":"US-Highgate Center-I-89 N (45.0152,-73.0844)","Latitude":"45.015234","Longitude":"-73.084414","Date":"2019-04-27","Time":"02:13 PM","Protocol":"eBird Random Location Count","Duration (Min)":"40","All Obs Reported":"0","Distance Traveled (km)":".2","Area Covered (ha)":"","Number of Observers":"1","Breeding Code":"","Observation Details":"Clearly seen as Swifts from wing shape.","Checklist Comments":"A copied list of https://ebird.org/vt/view/checklist/S55473851 to reflect that I saw birds while sitting on both sides of the border.

Identified partially based on photographs from https://ebird.org/vt/view/checklist/S50824462, which I looked at before coming. The bird was tan all over, without large white sections, and it lacked black tips on its primaries. It was sitting on the long mounds perpendicular to the main mound where most of the gulls normally sit.    Any other comments would be biased by the photographs above, and based on the time elapsed - 1.5 months - since submitted this post and updating this comment, probably wouldn't be helpful. I spoke to Bryan Pfeiffer soon after seeing this gull - within a day or two - and confirmed the lack of black tips with him.","State":"Vermont","Region":"Northern Green Mountains"},{"Submission ID":"S50925779","Common Name":"Red-tailed Hawk","Scientific Name":"Buteo jamaicensis","Taxonomic Order":"8011","Count":"1","State/Province":"US-VT","County":"Washington","Location ID":"L8297157","Location":"I-89 S, Montpelier US-VT (44.2696,-72.6317)","Latitude":"44.269632","Longitude":"-72.631654","Date":"2018-12-24","Time":"01:38 PM","Protocol":"eBird - Casual Observation","Duration (Min)":"","All Obs Reported":"0","Distance Traveled (km)":"","Area Covered (ha)":"","Number of Observers":"1","Breeding Code":"","Observation Details":"","Checklist Comments":"While driving.","State":"Vermont","Region":"Northern Green Mountains"}],"2018-12-25":[{"Submission ID":"S50951706","Common Name":"Hairy Woodpecker","Scientific Name":"Dryobates villosus","Taxonomic Order":"10831","Count":"1","State/Province":"US-VT","County":"Washington","Location ID":"L1968086","Location":"Monroe Trail","Latitude":"44.311543","Longitude":"-72.863327","Date":"2018-12-25","Time":"02:00 PM","Protocol":"eBird - Traveling Count","Duration (Min)":"120","All Obs Reported":"1","Distance Traveled (km)":"5.633","Area Covered (ha)":"","Number of Observers":"1","Breeding Code":"","Observation Details":"","Checklist Comments":"Late afternoon walk.
